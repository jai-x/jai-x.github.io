Hello, I'm Jai and this is my website.

I'm a software engineer and I sometimes write on this website about
various things and you can find my posts below. I have some programming projects
which you can find on my Github page. I'd like to get to know more about
computer graphics programming at some point. I am currently available for hire
and you can find my [CV here](/static/misc/cv.pdf). You can tweet at me on
Twitter on contact me via Email using the links on this page.
