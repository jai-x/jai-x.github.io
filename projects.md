### [crashfm.live](https://crashfm.live)
A website that acts like the radio station CrashFM from the Burnout game series.
Made in Javascript using [mithril](https://mithril.js.org) for component hierarchy
and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for animation.

### [gamers.fail](https://gamers.fail)
A weekly newsletter giving a roundup of the top "games" "news" from /r/Games for the week.
Inspired by [n-gate](http://n-gate.com).
Hasn't been updated in ages (I should probably get back on that).

### [elden-game](/misc/elden-game)
A game I made for a friend as part of a friend-group gift exchange.
It features their cat as the main collectable!
Made in Javascript using the [Phaser game engine](https://phaser.io/) to play in a browser.
Hopefully it all still works.

### [renderer](https://github.com/jai-x/renderer)
An experiment in software rendering to teach me about graphics basics and C programming.
Based on [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) but adapted and written in C99.
Still not finished, but I will get around to it at some point.
