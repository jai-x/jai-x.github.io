Not being a lawyer, I am unable to distinguish if this is subversion of the law as written
or the law being bent into submission to the will of large corporations, but it sucks either way.

For some reason it's taken me until now to realise that I can just brain dump
my opinions as long form text rather than just talk about what I've done or what I'm
struggling with or shitpost. At least I can have this written up for future reference and
likely to look back in few years and cringe at myself.
