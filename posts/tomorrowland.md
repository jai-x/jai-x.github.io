# Tomorrowland and the death of the future
**2022-10-07**
draft

This post is about [Tomorrowland: A World Beyond][t_land_wiki], a 2015 film starring
George Clooney and directed by Brad Bird.
Tomorrowland was a bit of a commercial failure and received only mild praise,
earning it a [strong 50%][t_land_rt] on Rotten Tomatoes.
It's named after, and inspired by, the futuristic themed attraction at Disney parks
and I sort of wonder if this film was only ever made to be just another part of
the all consuming presence of Disney marketing.
Despite all this I feel the corporate behemoth of modern Disney may have accidentally
produced a film that is relevant and poignant, especially in current times where
outlook on the future can be kind of bleak.

Spoilers ahead.
